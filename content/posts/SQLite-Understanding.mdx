# Understanding SQLite3: Key Concepts, Data Types, and Basic Operations

SQLite3, a powerful variant of the SQLite database, is a self-contained, serverless SQL database engine that is both easy to set up and incredibly powerful. It has carved out its space in everything from embedded systems and mobile apps to desktop software and large-scale web applications. This post aims to introduce you to the most important aspects of SQLite3, such as its key features, data types, and basic operations.

## Key Features of SQLite3

### Self-contained
SQLite3 is a self-contained system, which means it requires minimal setup and configuration. This makes it an excellent choice for developers looking for a straightforward and uncomplicated database solution.

### Serverless Architecture
Unlike traditional databases that operate on client-server architecture, SQLite3 is serverless. This means you don't need a separate server to operate your database; it resides locally on the client machine.

### ACID Compliant
SQLite3 supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring reliable and secure database transactions.

### Open Source
Being open source gives SQLite3 the advantage of a large community of developers that continually contribute to its improvement.

### Cross-Platform
SQLite3 supports various platforms including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it extremely flexible.

## Data Types in SQLite3

SQLite3 has a small set of data types which are mapped to a broader set of data types in other database management systems:

- **NULL**: Represents a missing value or an undefined one.
- **INTEGER**: A signed integer.
- **REAL**: A floating-point value.
- **TEXT**: A text string.
- **BLOB**: Binary Large Object; could be images, audio, or any other kind of binary data.

## Basic Operations

### Creating a Database

Creating a new database is as simple as connecting to it. You can use various programming languages like Python, C, or you can use the SQLite3 shell. Here is how you'd create a new database in **terminal** on mac:
```zsh
sqlite3 database_Name.db
```
If you already have a database, you can acces with the same command on terminal:
```zsh
sqlite3 database_Name.db
```
to exit from sqlite mode you can type `.exit` in terminal and press enter.
```zsh
.exit
```
### Tables Management

Once connected to a database, you can create tables using the `CREATE TABLE` SQL statement. Here’s how you'd create a table to store information about students:

```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    grade REAL
);
```
You may also make other operations like `ALTER`:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN gender TEXT;
  ```
or `DELETE`:
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE students;
  ```
*is important to mention that delete tables is not a good pratice, since it represents a important data loss, a good alternative for that is make a backup on another database or export as .csv, so you can consult this data later or restore in the database if needed.*

### Inserting Data

To insert new records into your table, you use the `INSERT INTO` statement.

```sql
INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, grade)
VALUES (1, 'John', 20, 8.5);
```

### Querying Data

Querying data from your SQLite3 database involves using the `SELECT` SQL statement.

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

This query will return all records from the `students` table.

### Updating Data

Updating existing records is done with the `UPDATE` SQL statement.

```sql
UPDATE students
SET grade = 9.0
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Deleting Data

To remove records, you use the `DELETE FROM` statement.

```sql
DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 1;
```

# Understanding SQLite Operators: A Comprehensive Guide

SQLite is a C library that facilitates lightweight, disk-based database management that can be easily integrated with various programming languages like Python, C, C++, and Java, among others. At its core, SQLite operates using SQL (Structured Query Language), which is used to communicate with a relational database. 

One of the most fundamental aspects of SQL in SQLite involves the use of operators—these are symbols or keywords that perform operations on operands. Operators are critical for data manipulation, retrieval, and updating. This blog post aims to dissect the types of operators in SQLite and provide examples for each.

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators perform basic arithmetic operations.

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `%` : Modulus

### Example

```sql
SELECT salary, (salary * 0.10) AS 'Salary Increment'
FROM employees;
```

## Comparison Operators

These operators compare one operand with another and return a boolean result.

- `=` `==` : Equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `<>` or `!=` : Not equal to

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE age >= 25;
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine two or more conditions.

- `AND`: True if all conditions are true
- `OR`: True if at least one condition is true
- `NOT`: True if the condition is false

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE age >= 25 AND department = 'HR';
```

## Bitwise Operators

These are specialized operators used for manipulation at the bit-level.

- `&`: Bitwise AND
- `|`: Bitwise OR
- `~`: Bitwise NOT
- `<<`: Shift left
- `>>`: Shift right

### Example

```sql
SELECT (4 | 1);  -- Outputs 5
```

## String Operators

SQLite has some implicit string operators.

- `||`: String Concatenation
- `LIKE`: String matching with wildcard support
- `GLOB`: String matching with Unix glob patterns

### Example

```sql
SELECT firstName || ' ' || lastName AS 'Full Name'
FROM employees;
```

## Compound Operators

SQLite supports the following compound operators as shorthand for operations that update data.

- `+=`: Increment and assign
- `-=`: Decrement and assign
- `*=`: Multiply and assign
- `/=`: Divide and assign
- `%=`: Modulus and assign

### Example

Unfortunately, SQLite doesn't natively support these compound operators, but you can simulate the functionality.

```sql
-- Simulating +=
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = column1 + 1;
```

## NULL Handling Operators

SQLite provides two main NULL handling mechanisms.

- `IS NULL`: True if the operand is NULL
- `IS NOT NULL`: True if the operand is not NULL
- `IFNULL()`: Replace NULL with a specified value
- `COALESCE()`: Return the first non-NULL value in a list

### Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IS NOT NULL;
```

## Conclusion

Understanding the wide array of operators available in SQLite is crucial for efficient database operations. Whether you're filtering data, performing calculations, or manipulating data at the bit level, operators make these tasks both possible and efficient. The next step is to combine these operators in meaningful ways to solve complex queries and data manipulation tasks.

In SQLite, there are several advanced comparison operators that go beyond basic equality or inequality checks. Here's an overview:

### LIKE

The `LIKE` operator is used for string pattern matching. It supports wildcard characters: `%` to represent zero or more characters and `_` to represent exactly one character.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'Jo%';
```

### GLOB

Similar to `LIKE`, but `GLOB` performs case-sensitive pattern matching and supports UNIX-style wildcards: `*`, `?`, and `[]`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name GLOB 'Jo*';
```

### IN

The `IN` operator is used to filter records against a set of values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Engineering');
```

### BETWEEN ... AND ...

The `BETWEEN ... AND ...` operator filters records based on a range.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 35;
```

### IS NULL and IS NOT NULL

These operators are used to check for NULL values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IS NULL;
```

### EXISTS

The `EXISTS` operator is used to check for the existence of rows that satisfy a given condition within a subquery.

```sql
SELECT * FROM departments WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM employees WHERE departments.department_id = employees.department_id);
```

### CASE

The `CASE` expression is more of a conditional expression than an operator per se, but it's often lumped in with advanced comparison operations. It's used to implement if-else logic in SQL queries.

```sql
SELECT name,
       CASE 
           WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young'
           WHEN age BETWEEN 30 AND 50 THEN 'Middle-aged'
           ELSE 'Old'
       END as age_category
FROM employees;
```

### COLLATE

The `COLLATE` operator is used to specify a collation sequence for string comparison.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees ORDER BY name COLLATE NOCASE;
```

### ||

The concatenation operator `||` is sometimes considered an advanced comparison operator when used in conjunction with other operators for string manipulation and comparisons.

```sql
SELECT firstName || ' ' || lastName AS 'Full Name' FROM employees;
```

### MATCH

Used for full-text search, it's specific to tables that are set up with the FTS (Full Text Search) extension.

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title MATCH 'adventure';
```

### REGEXP

SQLite doesn't have built-in regular expression support, but you can add it via a user-defined function.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name REGEXP '^Jo.*';
```

Understanding these advanced operators provides greater flexibility in data manipulation and querying, allowing you to perform complex operations with ease.

# Constraints

SQLite supports several types of constraints that allow you to enforce certain rules on the data within your tables. Constraints can be specified at the column level or at the table level. Here's an overview of the primary constraints available in SQLite:

### PRIMARY KEY

A `PRIMARY KEY` constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Each table can only have one primary key, which can consist of one or multiple columns.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);
```

### UNIQUE

The `UNIQUE` constraint ensures that all values in a column are distinct.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    email TEXT UNIQUE
);
```

### NOT NULL

The `NOT NULL` constraint ensures that a column cannot contain `NULL` values.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### CHECK

The `CHECK` constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    age INTEGER CHECK(age >= 18)
);
```

### DEFAULT

The `DEFAULT` constraint sets a default value for a column when no value is provided during an `INSERT` operation.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    age INTEGER DEFAULT 30
);
```

### FOREIGN KEY

The `FOREIGN KEY` constraint identifies a set of columns in one table that refers to a set of columns in another table. It is used to enforce referential integrity.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    orderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    employeeID INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (employeeID) REFERENCES employees(ID)
);
```

### COLLATE

The `COLLATE` constraint is used to specify a collation sequence for ordering data. It's more of a column constraint that affects how string comparison is done.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT COLLATE NOCASE
);
```

### AUTOINCREMENT

In SQLite, `AUTOINCREMENT` is used along with the `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` constraint to automatically increment the primary key value when new rows are added. Note that SQLite has some peculiarities regarding how it handles `AUTOINCREMENT`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT
);
```

### WITHOUT ROWID

While not a constraint in the traditional sense, `WITHOUT ROWID` changes the underlying data structure of the table to omit the built-in `ROWID` column, affecting how the table handles primary keys. This can lead to performance improvements in certain cases.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
) WITHOUT ROWID;
```

### Single and Multiple CHECK Constraints

You can have multiple `CHECK` constraints on a single column or across multiple columns. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE persons (
    ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INTEGER,
    status TEXT,
    CHECK(age >= 0),
    CHECK(age <= 150),
    CHECK((status = 'married' AND age >= 18) OR status != 'married')
);
```

Understanding these constraints allows you to better design your SQLite database schemas and enforce integrity rules on your data.

# Understanding the SELECT Statement in SQLite: A Comprehensive Guide

SQLite is one of the most widely-used relational database management systems. It is highly efficient, lightweight, and can be integrated into various types of applications, including mobile and web apps. One of the core SQL commands used to query an SQLite database is the `SELECT` statement. This article aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the `SELECT` statement in SQLite.

## Basic Syntax of SELECT

The `SELECT` statement is used to query tables in a database and retrieve specific data. Here's the basic syntax:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition; 
```

For example:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;
```

### Selecting All Columns

To select all columns from a table, you use the asterisk (*) symbol:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees;
```

## Filtering with WHERE

The `WHERE` clause filters records based on one or more conditions:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE age >= 30 AND name LIKE 'John%';
```

## Sorting with ORDER BY

The `ORDER BY` keyword is used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
ORDER BY age ASC;
```

## Limiting Results with LIMIT

The `LIMIT` keyword is used to limit the number of rows returned:

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
LIMIT 5;
```

## Aggregate Functions

SQLite supports various aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, and `AVG()`:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;
```

## Joins

SQLite supports different types of joins including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and CROSS JOIN.

### INNER JOIN

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### LEFT JOIN

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

## Subqueries

A subquery or inner query is a query within another SQL query:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'HR');
```

## DISTINCT Keyword

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return unique values:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department_id
FROM employees;
```

## Conclusion

The `SELECT` statement is a highly flexible and powerful tool for querying SQLite databases. It provides numerous options for specifying exactly what data you want to retrieve, how you want to filter it, and in what order you want the results. Mastering the `SELECT` statement is essential for anyone who wants to work with SQLite databases effectively.

From filtering with the `WHERE` clause to joining tables and using aggregate functions, there's a lot you can do with `SELECT`. As you get more comfortable with it, you'll find that it allows you to perform complex operations and retrieve very specific data sets, making your applications more dynamic and data-driven.

Whether you're a beginner just starting out with SQLite or a seasoned developer looking to refresh your knowledge, understanding how to use the `SELECT` statement effectively is a crucial skill.

Certainly! I'll include explanations and examples for the `OFFSET` and `HAVING` clauses, extending our comprehensive guide to the `SELECT` statement in SQLite.

---

## OFFSET: Skipping Rows

The `OFFSET` clause is used in conjunction with `LIMIT` to skip a specific number of rows before returning the result set. This is useful for implementing pagination.

```sql
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10;
```

In this example, the first 10 rows will be skipped, and the next 5 rows will be returned.

## HAVING: Filtering Aggregated Data

While the `WHERE` clause is used for filtering rows, the `HAVING` clause is used for filtering the result set based on a condition applied to an aggregated data. The `HAVING` clause comes after the `GROUP BY` clause.

For example, consider an `employees` table with columns `id`, `name`, `age`, and `department_id`. Let's say you want to find departments with more than 5 employees who are older than 30.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

In this query, `GROUP BY` groups the employees by their `department_id`, and `COUNT(*)` counts the number of employees in each group. The `HAVING` clause then filters out the groups that don't meet the condition of having more than 5 employees.

### Combining WHERE, GROUP BY, and HAVING

These clauses can be used together for more complex queries. Here's an example that uses all three:

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(age)
FROM employees
WHERE age > 20
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(age) > 30
ORDER BY AVG(age) DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

In this example, we first filter the employees who are older than 20 using the `WHERE` clause. Then, we group them by `department_id` and calculate the average age within each department using `AVG(age)`. The `HAVING` clause then filters out departments where the average age is not greater than 30. Finally, the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses sort the remaining departments by average age in descending order and limit the output to 5 rows.

## Conclusion

The `SELECT` statement in SQLite is a versatile and powerful query tool. With the addition of `OFFSET` for pagination and `HAVING` for filtering aggregated data, you gain even more control over the data you retrieve. These advanced options provide you with the flexibility to write more complex, efficient queries, making it easier to build dynamic, data-driven applications. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, mastering these functionalities of the `SELECT` statement will undoubtedly make your SQLite journey more effective and rewarding.

Manipulating and filtering alphanumeric data can be achieved using a variety of methods in different programming languages and databases. In this discussion, I will focus on SQL and SQLite, a popular relational database management system.

### SQL and SQLite Methods for Alphanumeric Data Manipulation

`length(str), lower(str), upper(str), substr(str,start,length), trim(str)`
`replace(str, pattern, replace), instr(str, substring)` `instr=return index` just replace the output but no the original data if is used as select element
`can be nested for example, to capitalize: select upper(substr(name,1,1)||lower(name,2,length(name)-1)) where lenght(name) > 0`

#### 1. String Concatenation

SQL allows the concatenation of two or more strings. The `||` operator can be used for this purpose.

```sql
SELECT 'Hello' || ' ' || dataField;  
```

This will output `Hello World`.

#### 2. Substring Extraction

The `SUBSTR()` function extracts a substring from a string, given a starting position and length.

```sql
SELECT SUBSTR('Hello World', 1, 5);
```

This will output `Hello`.

#### 3. String Replacement

Although SQLite does not natively support string replacement, you can create custom functions in languages like Python and use them within SQLite.

#### 4. String Length

You can use the `LENGTH()` function to get the length of a string.

```sql
SELECT LENGTH('Hello World');
```

This will output `11`.

#### 5. Case Conversion

You can convert the case of alphabetic characters in strings using `UPPER()` and `LOWER()`.

```sql
SELECT UPPER('Hello');
SELECT LOWER('WORLD');
```

This will output `HELLO` and `world`, respectively.

### SQL and SQLite Methods for Alphanumeric Data Filtering

#### 1. Exact Match

You can filter records based on an exact match using the `=` operator.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = 'value';
```

#### 2. Partial Match using LIKE

The `LIKE` operator can be used for partial string matching.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE 'A%';
```

This will return all records where the `column` starts with the letter 'A'.

#### 3. Regular Expression Matching

SQLite doesn't support full regular expressions, but if it's a requirement, you can use auxiliary libraries or manipulate data outside of SQLite for this purpose.

#### 4. IN Clause

The `IN` clause can be used to filter records based on a list of values.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IN ('value1', 'value2', 'value3');
```

#### 5. NOT LIKE and NOT IN

These operators serve as the opposite of `LIKE` and `IN`, filtering out records that match the conditions.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column NOT LIKE 'A%';
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column NOT IN ('value1', 'value2');
```

#### 6. GLOB Operator

The `GLOB` operator is similar to `LIKE` but uses Unix shell-style wildcards.

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column GLOB 'A*';
```

These methods can be combined and modified according to the specific requirements of your query, providing powerful tools to manipulate and filter alphanumeric data in SQL and SQLite.

# Exploring Math Functions in SQLite: A Comprehensive Guide

SQLite is a versatile, self-contained database engine known for its efficiency and ease of use. While it may not have the extensive set of math functions found in other SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, SQLite does offer a set of handy built-in functions that can perform a variety of mathematical operations.

6. [Aggregation Functions](#Aggregation-Functions)
7. [Creating Custom Math Functions](#Creating-Custom-Math-Functions)
8. [Conclusion](#Conclusion)

## Introduction

While SQLite is not a full-fledged scientific computing tool, you'll find it provides sufficient math functionalities for most everyday applications. Let's look at what SQLite has to offer.

## Basic Arithmetic Operations

SQLite offers basic arithmetic operations that can be performed directly in SQL queries:

- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`)

### Example:

```sql
SELECT (10 + 2) AS addition, 
       (10 - 2) AS subtraction,
       (10 * 2) AS multiplication,
       (10 / 2) AS division,
       (10 % 3) AS modulus;
```

## Rounding Functions

SQLite offers the `ROUND()` function to round numbers to a specified decimal point.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 2) AS rounded_number;
```

This will output `123.46`.

## Trigonometric Functions

SQLite lacks built-in trigonometric functions. However, you can add custom trigonometric functions using third-party libraries or language bindings, such as Python’s SQLite3 module.

## Random Numbers

SQLite has a built-in function for generating random numbers called `RANDOM()`.

### Example:

```sql
SELECT RANDOM() AS random_number;
```

This will generate a random integer between the minimum and maximum values of a signed 64-bit integer.

## Aggregation Functions

Aggregation functions operate on a set of rows and return a single summary value.

- `SUM()`: Sum of values
- `AVG()`: Average of values
- `MIN()`: Minimum value
- `MAX()`: Maximum value

### Example:

```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name) AS sum_value,
       AVG(column_name) AS avg_value,
       MIN(column_name) AS min_value,
       MAX(column_name) AS max_value
FROM table_name;
```

## Creating Custom Math Functions

SQLite’s functionality can be extended through the use of custom functions. You can write your own functions in C, Python, or any other language that has SQLite bindings, and then add these functions to the SQLite environment. This is particularly useful for complex mathematical operations not supported natively by SQLite.

For example, in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

def square_root(x):
    return x ** 0.5

con = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
con.create_function("sqrt", 1, square_root)
```

Now you can use `sqrt` in your SQL queries within that Python program.

## Conclusion

SQLite’s suite of mathematical functions is not as extensive as other SQL databases, but it does cover the basics and provides the flexibility to add custom functions. Whether you’re building a complex application or just need to run some quick calculations on your data, SQLite offers enough functionality to meet most needs. With the option to extend its features, SQLite stands as a versatile tool for numerical operations.

## Data Types for Dates and Time

SQLite supports the following formats for storing date and time values:

- TEXT (ISO8601 string): `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS"`
- REAL (Julian day numbers)
- INTEGER (Unix Time, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)

```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    event_date TEXT
);
```

## Date and Time Functions

`we can use data generated from system with CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
SQLite provides a variety of functions for working with date and time values.

### strftime

The `strftime` function allows you to format date and time.
%Y year
%d day
%m month
%M Minute
%H Hour

```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-%m-%d', 'now');
```

### date

The `date` function returns the date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

```sql
SELECT date('now');
```

### time

The `time` function gives the time of day in `HH:MM:SS` format.

```sql
SELECT time('now');
```

### datetime

The `datetime` function returns the date and time in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.

```sql
SELECT datetime('now');
```

### julianday

The `julianday` function returns the Julian day number, which can be used for date-time calculations.

```sql
SELECT julianday('now');
```

## Arithmetic Operations

SQLite allows basic arithmetic operations on date and time values.

```sql
-- Adding 1 day to the current date
SELECT date('now', '+1 day');

-- Subtracting 60 seconds from the current time
SELECT datetime('now', '-60 seconds');
```

## Formatting Dates and Times

You can use the `strftime` function to format date and time in various ways:

```sql
-- Get the current year
SELECT strftime('%Y', 'now');

-- Get the current month
SELECT strftime('%m', 'now');

-- Get the current day of the month
SELECT strftime('%d', 'now');
```

## Common Queries

Here are some common queries involving date and time:

```sql
-- Get all events happening today
SELECT * FROM events WHERE date(event_date) = date('now');

-- Get all events in the future
SELECT * FROM events WHERE date(event_date) > date('now');

-- Get all events for a specific year
SELECT * FROM events WHERE strftime('%Y', event_date) = '2022';
```

## Conclusion

SQLite offers a range of functionalities to manipulate dates and times, making it easy to perform common operations such as formatting, comparison, and arithmetic. Though SQLite does not have specialized date and time data types, its powerful built-in functions more than compensate for this, offering flexibility and power in handling date-time values.


## Download Options
